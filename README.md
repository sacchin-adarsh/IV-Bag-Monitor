# **IV-Bag-Monitor**
During the peak of the Covid-19 Pandemic, healthcare professionals found themselves
spread thin among the ever-increasing wave of incoming patients. In such times, it is not
possible for frontline workers to monitor and tend to each and every patient personally.
Intravenous therapy is a medical technique used to deliver fluids, medications and
nutrition directly into a personâ€™s vein. IV therapy is commonly used for rehydration and to
provide nutrients and is crucial to help an individual with making a speedy recovery.
However, IV drips need to be regularly monitored and replaced. The flow of the fluid
also needs to be metered depending on the patient and their ailment. To address this need the
IoT Intravenous Fluid Monitoring uses a weight sensor to detect as the fluid level in the IV
Infusion bottle goes down and transmits the data over IoT. Once the system detects that the
bottle has gone empty, it sends an alert over IoT
